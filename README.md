Equus caballus Reference Panel and Chromosome-Specific Genetic Diversity Analysis
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Equus caballus Reference Panel and Chromosome-Specific Genetic Diversity Analysis project! This repository serves as a central hub for the various stages of our project, aimed at developing a comprehensive reference panel for Equus caballus and conducting in-depth chromosome-specific analyses to unravel its genetic diversity.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to create a high-quality reference panel for Equus caballus, commonly known as the domestic horse. We have divided the project into several key stages to streamline our progress:

Sequence Download: Here, you'll find the accession codes of the samples used in our study. This crucial step lays the foundation for all subsequent analyses.

Filtering: 

Mapping: 

Variant Calling: 

Merging: 

Quality Checks: 

R Plotting: Our project involves various R scripts such as evalADMIX.sh to generate insightful plots, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), admixture analyses, and more.

Data: This directory hosts additional data files that are uploaded as part of the ongoing research process.


Getting Started
If you're new tothis repository, we recommend starting with the README.md file, where you can find an overview of the project, its goals, and a breakdown of the different stages. Feel free to explore the directories and scripts to gain a deeper understanding of our workflow.

Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're interested in refining the analysis scripts, improving data processing, or adding new analyses, please review our contribution guidelines in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
